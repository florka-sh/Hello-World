<h1>What is Python used for?</h1>
<p>Clearly, Python is a popular and in-demand skill to learn. But what is python programming used for? We’ve already
briefly touched on some of the areas it can be applied to, and we’ve expanded on these and more Python examples below.
Python can be used for:
</p>
<h4>1. AI and machine learning</h4>
<p>
Because Python is such a stable, flexible, and simple programming language, it’s perfect for various machine learning
(ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) projects. In fact, Python is among the favourite languages among data scientists,
and there are many Python machine learning and AI libraries and packages available.

If you’re interested in this application of Python, our Deep Learning and Python Programming for AI with Microsoft Azure
ExpertTrack can help you develop your skills in these areas. You can discover the uses of Python and deep learning while
boosting your career in AI.
</p>
<h4>2. Data analytics</h4>
<p>
Much like AI and machine learning, data analytics is another rapidly developing field that utilises Python programming.
At a time when we`re creating more data than ever before, there is a need for those who can collect, manipulate and
organise the information.

Python for data science and analytics makes sense. The language is easy-to-learn, flexible, and well-supported, meaning
it’s relatively quick and easy to use for analysing data. When working with large amounts of information, it’s useful
for manipulating data and carrying out repetitive tasks.

You can learn about data analytics using Python with our ExpertTrack, which will help you develop practical data
analytics skills.
</p>
<h4>3. Data visualisation</h4>
<p>
Data visualisation is another popular and developing area of interest. Again, it plays into many of the strengths of
Python. As well as its flexibility and the fact it’s open-source, Python provides a variety of graphing libraries with
all kinds of features.

Whether you’re looking to create a simple graphical representation or a more interactive plot, you can find a library to
match your needs. Examples include Pandas Visualization and Plotly. The possibilities are vast, allowing you to
transform data into meaningful insights.

If data visualisation with Python sounds appealing, check out our 12-week ExpertTrack on the subject. You’ll learn how
to leverage Python libraries to interpret and analyse data sets.
</p>
<h4>4. Programming applications</h4>
<p>
You can program all kinds of applications using Python. The general-purpose language can be used to read and create file
directories, create GUIs and APIs, and more. Whether it’s blockchain applications, audio and video apps, or machine
learning applications, you can build them all with Python.

We also have an ExpertTrack on programming applications with Python, which can help to kick-start your programming
career. Over the course of 12 weeks, you’ll gain an introduction on how to use Python, and start programming your own
applications using it.

<h4>5. Web development</h4>
<p>
Python is a great choice for web development. This is largely due to the fact that there are many Python web development
frameworks to choose from, such as Django, Pyramid, and Flask. These frameworks have been used to create sites and
services such as Spotify, Reddit and Mozilla.

Thanks to the extensive libraries and modules that come with Python frameworks, functions such as database access,
content management, and data authorisation are all possible and easily accessible. Given its versatility, it’s hardly
surprising that Python is so widely used in web development.
</p>
<h4>6. Game development</h4>
<p>
Although far from an industry-standard in game development, Python does have its uses in the industry. It’s possible to
create simple games using the programming language, which means it can be a useful tool for quickly developing a
prototype. Similarly, certain functions (such as dialogue tree creation) are possible in Python.

If you’re new to either Python or game development, then you can also discover how to make a text-based game in Python.
In doing so, you can work on a variety of skills and improve your knowledge in various areas.
</p>
<h4>7. Language development</h4>
<p>
The simple and elegant design of Python and its syntax means that it has inspired the creation of new programming
languages. Languages such as Cobra, CoffeeScript, and Go all use a similar syntax to Python.

This fact also means that Python is a useful gateway language. So, if you’re totally new to programming, understanding
Python can help you branch out into other areas more easily.
</p>
<h4>8. Finance</h4>
<p>
Python is increasingly being utilised in the world of finance, often in areas such as quantitative and qualitative
analysis. It can be a valuable tool in determining asset price trends and predictions, as well as in automating
workflows across different data sources.

As mentioned already, Python is an ideal tool for working with big data sets, and there are many libraries available to
help with compiling and processing information. As such, it’s one of the preferred languages in the finance industry.

<h4>9. SEO</h4>
<p>
Another slightly surprising entry on our list of Python uses is in the field of search engine optimisation (SEO). It’s
an area that often benefits from automation, which is certainly possible through Python. Whether it’s implementing
changes across multiple pages or categorising keywords, Python can help.

Emerging technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) are also likely to be relevant to those working in SEO.
Python can be a powerful tool in developing these NLP skills and understanding how people search and how search engines
return results.
</p>
<h4>10. Design</h4>
<p>
When asking ‘what is Python used for?’ you probably weren’t expecting design to feature on the list. However, Python can
be used to develop graphic design applications. Surprisingly, the language is used across a range of 2D imaging
software, such as Paint Shop Pro and Gimp.
</p>
Python is even used in 3D animation software such as Lightwave, Blender, and Cinema 4D, showing just how versatile the
language is.
